!!Important!!
  Do not try any of the following attacks on an ordinary site. They WILL send you to jail.



Welcome to Hackkit. It's just like Reddit. Well, except for the lack of misogynistic trolls.  It's also ok to break the site without going to jail. 

To start:

In the console run.

1.  bundle install
2.  shotgun config.ru


When you are succesful, and break the site, please use the, 
bundle exec rake db:reset
bundle exec rake db:seed

commands to reset the test site.

There are several vectors included in this challenge. Each one of the attacks, listed below, will require research and quite a bit of thought involved in order to execute. Have fun!! 

1. Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
2. Weak Params
3. Social Engineering

4. SQL Injection

If you should find yourself unable to execute a specific attack, try harder. If after significant effort your attempts prove fruitless, feel free to peek at the Info.md file.
