      <h4>Insights</h4>
      <p>Certain types of businesses, such as financial services firms, have faced cybersecurity threats for decades. Many manufacturing sectors haven’t experienced as great an impetus to establish comprehensive cybersecurity capabilities. Some segments, such as aerospace, defense, automotive and chemical, due to safety or national security concerns, have an edge on others when, not that long ago, securing assets was almost as simple as posting a guard at the plant door.
      Stuxnet, which was discovered in 2010, changed that perception, and the manufacturing industry’s focus on securing industrial control systems (ICS) began to mature. The Stuxnet worm, which was used to ultimately destroy the SCADA systems controlling Iranian nuclear centrifuges, proved that weapons-grade malware could be an effective offensive strategy and, if customized for its target, that software could effectively and permanently damage production.</p>
